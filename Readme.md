kregfile - the better volafile
===

a POC really, don't complain about messy code, it's a POC!

Instructions
---

- start a redis (hack broker.js if you wanna do non-default config)
- `yarn --dev`
- `yarn run pack` (to pack the shitty client side shit)
- then run `ìndex.js` for maximum cancer
- navigate to `[::1]:8080/r/whatever` and enjoy
